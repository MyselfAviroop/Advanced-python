## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

### âœ… 1. Processes & Threads  
Understand what processes and threads are and how they differ in Python.

### âœ… 2. Multithreading Practical Implementation  
Demonstrates how to use `threading` to run tasks concurrently, ideal for I/O-bound operations.

### âœ… 3. Multiprocessing Practical Implementation  
Showcases how to use `multiprocessing` for CPU-bound tasks to utilize multiple CPU cores.

### âœ… 4. ThreadPoolExecutor & ProcessPoolExecutor  
Simplifies concurrent execution using Python's `concurrent.futures` module.

### âœ… 5. Web Scraping Use Case with Multithreading  
Applies multithreading in a real-world web scraping project using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

### âœ… 6. Real-World Use Case with Multiprocessing  
Implements a practical multiprocessing scenario involving heavy computations like factorials.

### âœ… 7. Memory Management in Python  
Includes:
- Reference counting
